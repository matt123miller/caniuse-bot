## TODO

Take a look at my [TODO list](./TODO) which is powered by the 
[TODO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) for VSCode.
I'm a big fan of that extension.

## Publishing

Relies on [the np package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np). At the moment I'm running this in whichever fodler I want to publish:

`np --no-tests`

I'll add tests at some point....
